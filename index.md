### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

  lab04 part 2 is one of my favorites, these codes allow two players to enter and guess who is older and who is younger. Although this is a very basic game, just like PONG, it is full of meaning.


* Lab 5

  lab05 part 2 is one of my favorites. These codes can help users calculate the area of ​​a rectangle. Although the principle is simple, it is very convenient for engineering calculations.
  


* Lab 6

  lab06 part 2 is my favorite, one of my favorite poker games is blackjack. This game is very simple but has many rules. It is also very interesting for me to be able to incorporate the rules of ace cards into the program.
